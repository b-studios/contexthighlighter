Context Highlighter
===================

A syntax highlighter for JavaScript that focuses on scoping of functions rather than just lexical units.

This project is inspired by the slides of Douglas Crockford's talk [Monads and Gonads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0EF0VTs9Dc).

To use it, you'll need `node.js`, `esprima` and `scss` (only to compile the stylesheets).

You can find a sample output of the tool applied to it's own source code in the [gh-pages branch](http://b-studios.github.io/contexthighlighter/).
